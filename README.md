*TCGA-BRCA RNA-seq Analysis*

*Project Overview* :
This project presents a transcriptomic analysis of Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The objective was to explore gene expression patterns using RNA-seq data and build a structured computational workflow for cancer transcriptome analysis.
The analysis was conducted in R using Bioconductor packages and organized into modular scripts to ensure reproducibility and clarity.

*Objectives* :
Retrieve TCGA BRCA RNA-seq data
Preprocess and clean expression matrices
Perform exploratory transcriptomic analysis
Generate visual outputs for interpretation
Structure the workflow into reproducible scripts

*Tools & Technologies Used* :
R
Bioconductor
